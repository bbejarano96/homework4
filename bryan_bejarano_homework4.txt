Give the higher level (more complexly worded syntax) and the more basic syntax.for(initialization; condition; final-expression){statement}For loop syntax basic syntax:for (step1; step2; step3){}3.) What does the for loop basically do?Loops through a block of code a specified number of times.4.) Give an example of a for loop, and then explain what is going on with the code.for (I = 0; i < 10; i++){	text += "the number is " + i + "<br>";}Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 10).Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.5.) What characters (used in code) represents for loop code block?Use : ({      })6.) After the for loop code back has been executed, which step does the for loop program return to?For loop returns to step 27.) Give an example of a for loop that includes an if statement and a break statement within the if statement. Break statement example:function myFunction() {  var text = ""  var i;  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {    if (i === 3) {      break;    }    text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";  }  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;}8.) Give an example of a for loop that includes an if statement and a continue statement within the if statement. continue statement example:function myFunction() {  var text = "";  var i;  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {    if (i === 3) {      continue;    }    text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";  }  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;}9.) Give me an example of an array.       var donuts = ["Sprinkles", "Chocolate", "BostonCream"];document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = donuts;// Sprinkles,Chocolate,BostonCream10.) Give me another example of an array. You can use whatever data type you want inside.Another example of an array:let color  = ['Blue', 'Red', 'Orange', 'Green']console.log(color)// ["Blue", "Red", "Orange", "Green"]11.) Declare and initialize and array. var donuts = ['Sprinkles', 'Chocolate', 'BostonCream'];var x;for (x of donuts) {  document.write(x + "<br >");}//Sprinkles//Chocolate//BostonCream12.) Give an example of a for in loop.function myFunction() {  var person = {fname:"Adam", lname:"Will", age:59};     var text = "";  var x;  for (x in person) {    text += person[x] + " ";  }  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;}//Adam Will 5913.) Give an example of a for loop.const donutFlavor = ["Sprinkles", "Chocolate", "BostonCream", "Vanilla"]; for (const donutFlavorValue of donutFlavor) { console.log(donutFlavorValue); } 14.) Tell me what is the (main) difference between a for in loop and a for of loop.For of loop can only loop through the iterable objects.For in loops through the properties of an object.15.) Give me an example of a do while loop.do while loop example:var text = ""var i = 0;do {  text += "<br>The number is " + i;  i++;}while (i < 10);  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;//The number is 0//The number is 1//The number is 2//The number is 3//The number is 4//The number is 5//The number is 6//The number is 7//The number is 8//The number is 916.) What does a loop (in general) terminate?A loop terminates because of the conditions that was stated are no longer true.
